  - title: Cisco Security Cloud Control User guide
    copy: "I wrote the user guide for a web portal where Cisco customers can manage their Cisco security product subscriptions, manage product tenants, manage enterprises and users and more. I wrote instructions for using SAML to enable single sign-on with third-party identity providers, and for managing users and roles in the portal."

api_examples:
  - title: Apcera Platform API Reference
    copy: "I created the initial API reference for a turn-key container management system (Ã  la Kubernetes). All API endpoints and resource types were captured in an OpenAPI/Swagger specification (<a href=\"https://docs.apcera.com/api/apcera-api.json\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>) that I curated from a combination reading API source code, interviewing developers, and running tests against a local API server instance. The HTML output was generated by a custom Ruby build script I developed."

  - title: Apcera Platform API Recipes
    copy: "This is a companion guide to the Apcera Platform API reference that provides API call sequences (\"recipes\") for completing non-trivial API tasks. I based the recipes in part on source code for the platform's CLI tool, the initial reference API implementation, and from input from a sales engineer helping a prospective customer with a custom API implementation."

  - title: Events System API
    copy: "I was the sole author on this guide that explains use cases and provides code examples for an API used to monitor events in an Apcera container cluster. It includes a feature demonstration using the Apcera CLI tool, and a complete code example demonstrating how to subscribe to events with WebSockets in a web application."
