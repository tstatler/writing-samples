  - title: Apcera Platform API Reference
    copy: "I researched and created the API reference for managing a turn-key Docker container management system. All endpoints and resource types were described by a OpenAPI/Swagger specification (<a href=\"https://docs.apcera.com/api/apcera-api.json\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>) that I curated from a combination reading API source code, talking with developers, and running tests against a local API server instance to validate my understanding. The HTML output was generated by a Ruby build script that I developed."

  - title: Apcera Platform API Recipes
    copy: "This is a companion guide to the Apcera Platform API reference that provided sequences of API calls (\"recipes\") required to complete non-trivial API tasks. I based the recipes by inspecting source code for the platform's CLI tool, which was the reference API implementation, as well as input from a sales engineer helping a prospective customer with a custom API implementation."
