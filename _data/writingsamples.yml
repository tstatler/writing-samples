  - title: Apcera Platform API Reference
    copy: "I created the initial API reference for a turn-key container management system (Ã  la Kubernetes). All API endpoints and resource types were captured in an OpenAPI/Swagger specification (<a href=\"https://docs.apcera.com/api/apcera-api.json\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>) that I curated from a combination reading API source code, interviewing developers, and running tests against a local API server instance. The HTML output was generated by a custom Ruby build script I developed."

  - title: Apcera Platform API Recipes
    copy: "This is a companion guide to the Apcera Platform API reference that provides API call sequences (\"recipes\") for completing non-trivial API tasks. I based the recipes in part on source code for the platform's CLI tool, the initial reference API implementation, and from input from a sales engineer helping a prospective customer with a custom API implementation."
